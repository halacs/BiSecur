# Hörmann BiSecure Gateway Protocol GoLang SDK

Goal is to create a fully fledged replacement client after Hörmann stated end of life of their cloud and android application.

If all goes fine, later this repository will provide you both a GoLang SDK and a CLI client you can use to
- open and close your door
- manage users
- etc.

## Acknowledgement

Thanks for [SEC Consult](https://sec-consult.com/blog/detail/hoermann-opening-doors-for-everyone/) for the initial analysis and documentation.

Based on the above study someone could create a [Kotlin SDK](https://github.com/bisdk/sdk) which also helped me a lot.

Taken into consideration that Hörmann will stop their cloud required for BiSecure Gateway usages from 2024, I asked Hörmann support to publish their protocol already leaked in above repositories, but they stated that this code is impossible to write.
